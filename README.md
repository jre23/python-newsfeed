## Description

The goal for this project was to refactor a news feed app where users can post, comment, and upvote on links to news articles. The existing back-end was developed with Node.js/Express.js and was refactored using Python/Flask. See the following accomplishments list:

- Set up a virtual environment for Python by using the venv module.
- Defined functions and classes by using Python syntax.
- Created and imported Python packages and modules.
- Used the Flask library to create GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes.
- Created MySQL tables by using the SQLAlchemy ORM.
- Queried a database by using SQLAlchemy methods.
- Handled errors by using assert and try...except statements.
- Used the contextual g and session objects of Flask across routes.
- Imported custom filter functions into Jinja templates.
- Created custom decorator functions.
